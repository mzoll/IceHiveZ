A prototype Trigger
==========================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because the algorith HiveSplitter is designed to find physics hit through their clustering it is easily conceivable that the algorithm can also be used as a trigger, just indentiying the time windows in which a particle is present in the detector instead of fully splitting all hits into all individual subevents. This is now implemented in the algorithm HiveTrigger and the driver algorithm IceHiveTrigger, which interfaces to HitSpoolReader to demonstrate the capability and physics reach processing DOM-Launches from hitSpool data by this approach

HiveTrigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The HiveTrigger algorithm is in essence identical to the HiveSplitter algorithm. However in order that the higher precision of DOM-Launch times can be handled the transport object Hit is stroing this internally storing this as an int of DAQ-ticks. Also the algorithm relinguishes to store all the hits in each cluster and rather stores only the starting and ending times of each cluster. As a result there is no notion of subsevents or subclusters, as all overlapping subclusters will get merged into a a common global cluster.

When using HiveTrigger be aware that DOM-Launches are different hit objects than RecoPulses! A single DOMLaunch can contain a series of I3RecoPulses within itself, the DOMLaunch time being the impact time of the first hit in this series. So DOMLaunches are so fewer in IceCube data.

Parameters optimal for HiveSplitter working on I3RecoPulses are therefore not necessarily optimal for HiveTrigger as well. However, through the restriction parameter *AccepTimeWindow* for hit on the same DOM, the difference might actually not that drastic.

IceHiveTrigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current implementation forsees an implementation of of the HiveTrigger algorithm to the HitSpool-Reader. The hit transport layer between the HitSpool-Reader handling the DOM-Launches and the algorithm is Hits is called IceHiveTrigger. In a modified and improved version of HitSpool-Reader found here::

  http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/svn/sandbox/mzoll/hitspool-reader

the actual trigger algorithms are hooked into the Reader as bullet-ins, which derive from a global trigger class-template.

IceHiveTrigger Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The IceHiveTrigger instance needs to be created externally to the HitSpool-Reader, preferably by a ``HiveTrigger_ParameterSet``. This set has the following parameters, which work similarly to the parameters of the ``ÃŒ3HiveSplitter`` module:

* **multiplicity** [default=3] minimum number of mutually connected DOMs in order to form a cluster; In the further processing: Required multiplicity **minus one** of connected DOMs in each cluster to any further hit, in ordered that the hit is assigned to that cluster (the hit counts as one itself).
* **multiplicityTimeWindow** [default=1000 ns] Time span within which the multiplicity requirement must be met.
* **acceptTimeWindow** [default=1000 ns] [Default=NAN] Connect all hits on same DOM up to this time limit after the initial hit regardlessly [ns]; deactivate by 'NAN'
* **rejectTimeWindow** [Default=INF] Reject all hits on same DOM from to this time limit after the initial hit regardlessly [ns]; deactivate by 'INF'
* **connectionBlock** [No Default] A block of preconfigured ConnectionServices (specify either this or HiveConfigurationBlock)

It is mandatory to use preconfigured ConnetionBlock that is already hooked up to all necessary resources. The can be obtained by building the ``ConnectorBlock`` on the spot with the GCD objects or by linking a preconfigured ``ConnectorBlock`` by hand.

After this the HiveSplitter Module only needs to be passed to the HitSpool-Reader module under the parameter **Trigger**, and everything is set up.

Output
^^^^^^
The expected output from the HitSpool-Reader, as in normal application, Q-frames of triggered event-times containing all DOM-Launches during that time.

How to optimize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**There is always room for improvement.**

The default parameters in this project are not optimized. They are first guess values fuelled by experience from previous approaches to event splitting or hit-recognition/cleaning. However they work quite well and the performance with default settings is more than satisfactory.
